**Project Introduction: Budget Electric Bicycle Conversion**

This project involves the transformation of a conventional, manually powered bicycle into a functional and efficient electric bicycle. The objective is to complete this conversion while adhering to a strict cost constraint of under \$200. This initiative reflects a growing interest in sustainable and affordable transportation alternatives and is aimed at making electric mobility more accessible to a broader population.

The project commenced on June 28, 2025, and is expected to reach completion by July 12, 2025. Throughout this period, careful attention will be given to component selection, system integration, and overall design to ensure that the final product operates reliably, safely, and within legal speed limits set for electric bicycles.

Key aspects of the project include:

* Identifying and sourcing cost-effective electrical components (motor, battery, controller, etc.).
* Designing and implementing a power system compatible with the existing bicycle frame.
* Ensuring compliance with local regulations regarding electric bicycle performance, especially in terms of speed and safety.
* Maintaining the structural integrity and functionality of the original bicycle.

The success of this project will demonstrate the feasibility of low-cost electric vehicle conversions and contribute valuable insights into DIY sustainable transport solutions.
